Q)Four NoSQL databases with their differences, merits, demerits, and use cases:

1)MongoDB (Document Store)

Differences: Stores data in flexible JSON-like documents.
Merits: Schema-less, high scalability, supports indexing & aggregation.
Demerits: High memory usage, lacks ACID transactions (until newer versions).
Use Case: E-commerce platforms, content management systems.

2)Cassandra (Wide-Column Store)
Differences: Uses a distributed, column-family-based model.
Merits: Highly available, scalable, fault-tolerant.
Demerits: Complex queries, higher write latency.
Use Case: Real-time analytics, IoT applications.
Redis (Key-Value Store)

3)Differences: Stores data as key-value pairs in-memory.
Merits: Extremely fast, supports caching, pub/sub messaging.
Demerits: Limited durability (memory-based), not ideal for complex queries.
Use Case: Caching, real-time leaderboards.
Neo4j (Graph Database)

4)Differences: Stores data as nodes and relationships.
Merits: Efficient for complex relationships, easy traversal.
Demerits: Not optimized for high-volume transactions.
Use Case: Social networks, fraud detection.
