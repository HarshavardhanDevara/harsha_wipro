1. Differences Between L1, L2, and L3 Caches:
- L1 Cache: Closest to the CPU cores, it is the smallest (typically 32KB to 128KB) and fastest, with low latency and high bandwidth.
- L2 Cache: Located between L1 and L3, closer to CPU cores than L3. It is larger (256KB to 1MB) and slower than L1 but faster than L3.
- L3 Cache: Shared among CPU cores, it is the largest (1MB to several MBs) and slowest compared to L1 and L2, but still faster than main memory.

2. Cache Miss:
A cache miss occurs when the CPU requests data that is not found in the cache memory, requiring the CPU to fetch the data from a slower memory tier, such as RAM.

Three main types of cache misses:
- Cold Miss (Compulsory Miss): Occurs when data is accessed for the first time.
- Capacity Miss: Occurs when the cache cannot contain all the data needed by the program, causing some data to be evicted.
- Conflict Miss: Occurs when multiple data blocks compete for the same cache line, even if the cache could hold all the data.

3. Data-Level Parallelism (DLP) vs. Task-Level Parallelism (TLP):
- Data-Level Parallelism (DLP): This involves performing the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously. For example, matrix multiplication on a GPU, where each element is computed in parallel.
- Task-Level Parallelism (TLP): This involves running different tasks or processes concurrently. For example, a web server handling multiple client requests, where each request is processed on a different core.

4. Comparison of Smartphone Processors:
Let's compare the Apple iPhone 15 and the Samsung Galaxy S22.

- Processor Architecture: Both smartphones use ARM architecture. The iPhone 15 has the Apple A15 Bionic chip, while the Galaxy S22 uses the Exynos 2200 or Snapdragon 898, depending on the region.
- Clock Speed: The iPhone 15's processor runs at up to 3.2 GHz, while the Galaxy S22's processor runs at up to 3.0 GHz.
- Number of Cores: The iPhone 15 has 6 cores (2 performance and 4 efficiency cores), while the Galaxy S22 has 8 cores (1 Cortex-X2, 3 Cortex-A710, and 4 Cortex-A510).
- Energy Efficiency: The iPhone 15 is highly optimized for efficiency, while the Galaxy S22's efficiency varies by region and chipset variant.

Influence on performance and battery life:
- Architecture: Both processors are optimized for mobile devices. The Apple A15 Bionic is known for its balance of efficiency and performance.
- Clock Speed: Higher clock speeds can lead to faster performance but may consume more power.
- Number of Cores: More cores can handle more tasks simultaneously, improving multitasking. Efficiency cores save battery life during less intensive tasks.
- Energy Efficiency: A well-optimized processor leads to better battery life, with Apple often having an edge due to tight hardware-software integration.

5. CPU Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle Flowchart:
  Basic flow of the fetch-decode-execute cycle:
- Start
- Fetch (Fetch instruction from memory)
- Decode (Interpret the instruction)
- Execute (Perform the operation)
- Store (Write back result if needed)
- Repeat
