 1. Differences Between L1, L2, and L3 Caches

|   Cache Level   |   Location            |   Size                    | Speed                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| L1 Cache    | Closest to the CPU cores | Smallest (typically 32KB to 128KB) | Fastest (low latency, high bandwidth) |
| L2 Cache    | Between L1 and L3, closer to CPU cores than L3 | Larger (256KB to 1MB)          | Slower than L1 but faster than L3 |
| L3 Cache    | Shared among CPU cores | Largest (1MB to several MBs) | Slowest compared to L1 and L2 but faster than main memory |

 2. Cache Miss
A cache miss occurs when the data requested by the CPU is not found in the cache memory, causing the CPU to fetch the data from a slower memory tier (e.g., RAM).

 Three Main Types of Cache Misses:
- Cold Miss (Compulsory Miss): Occurs when data is accessed for the first time.
- Capacity Miss: Occurs when the cache cannot contain all the data needed by the program, causing some data to be evicted.
- Conflict Miss: Occurs when multiple data blocks compete for the same cache line, even if the cache could hold all the data.

 3. Data-Level Parallelism (DLP) vs. Task-Level Parallelism (TLP)

|   Parallelism Type   |      Description                    | Example                                            |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Data-Level Parallelism (DLP) | Performing the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously | Matrix multiplication on a GPU, where each element is computed in parallel |
| Task-Level Parallelism (TLP) | Running different tasks or processes concurrently | Web server handling multiple client requests, where each request is processed on a different core |

 4. Comparison of Smartphone Processors
Let's compare two popular smartphones: the Apple iPhone 15 and the Samsung Galaxy S22.

| Feature                | Apple iPhone 15             | Samsung Galaxy S22        |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Processor Architecture  | ARM-based Apple A15 Bionic      | ARM-based Exynos 2200 (or Snapdragon 898) |
| Clock Speed           | Up to 3.2 GHz                   | Up to 3.0 GHz                       |
| Number of Cores        | 6 cores (2 performance + 4 efficiency) | 8 cores (1 Cortex-X2, 3 Cortex-A710, 4 Cortex-A510) |
| Energy Efficiency       | Highly optimized for efficiency | Varies by region and chipset variant |

 Influence on Performance and Battery Life:
- Architecture: Both use ARM architecture, optimized for mobile devices. The Apple A15 Bionic is known for its efficiency and performance balance.
-Clock Speed: Higher clock speeds can lead to faster performance but may consume more power.
-Number of Cores: More cores can handle more tasks simultaneously, improving multitasking. Efficiency cores save battery life during less intensive tasks.
-Energy Efficiency: A well-optimized processor leads to better battery life, with Apple often having an edge due to tight hardware-software integration.
