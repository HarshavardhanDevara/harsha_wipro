# b) Guessing Number Program : You need to write a program that will generate a random number between 1 to 10 this number will have to be guessed 
#by the user and if they guess the number then print a message saying you guessed the number also print the number
#  of tries it took for the user to guess the number.Also give a limit of 5 guesses to the user if they don’t guess in 5 tries then print a message saying they 
# didn’t guess the number and print the actual number.
# Guess a number between 1 and 10: 1
# Your guess is too low you have 4 left
# Guess a number between 1 and 10: 3
# Your guess is too low you have 3 left
# Guess a number between 1 and 10: 9
# Your guess is too high you have 2 left
# Guess a number between 1 and 10: 9
# Your guess is too high you have 1 left
# Guess a number between 1 and 10: 9
# Your guess is too high you have 0 left
# You did not guess the number, The number was 5
import random
number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)

    guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))

        break
    elif guess < number_to_guess:
        print("Your guess is too low,", "you have", attempts - 1, "left")
    else:
        print("Your guess is too high,", "you have", attempts - 1, "left")
